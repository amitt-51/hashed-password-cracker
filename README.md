# Hashed Password Cracker

## Project Description
This project is a password cracker that works with different hashing algorithms. It allows you to crack passwords by using a wordlist and selected hash algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitt-51/hashed-password-cracker.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
